Heyo! 

My name is Peter and I do things sometimes; a small portion of which are here on my github! I have formal education in math and physics with an emphasis on plasma physics and control.

One day I will make this more fancy, but until then just relax and enjoy the cool calming radio of 103.5 dawn FM.

Peter
